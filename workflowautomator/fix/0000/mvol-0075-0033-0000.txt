Association of American Law Schools and is on the list of approved Law Schools of the
American Bar Association.' It is situated on the University Quadrangles adjacent to
the Midway. Washington Park lies to the ... vest and J�d:zo!l Park, the lake, �no thl'
South Park System to the East. TheSixtieth Street station of the Illinois Central Rail­
road is only thirteen minutes from the Loop, and bus, street railways, and the boule­
vards of the South Park system provide additional means of transportation.
THE LAW BUILDING
The Law School occupies a building erected particularly for it in 1904:. The buildinr
is three stories high, 175 feet long, and 80 feet wide. It is built of s'tone in the Gothic
type of architecture. The semi-English basement contains ample locker space and
lounge room. The classrooms are on the first floor and the stackroom on the second
floor. On the third floor is the reading-room, a beautiful, high-ceilinged, well-lighted
room with ample accommodations for studying. Around the walls are complete sets of
English and American law reports and statutes.

An extensive collection' of treatises (classical and modern), periodicals, trials, and

940,000 volumes. '
CURRICULUM
',I,
, .
The curriculum of the Law School is composed of two parts, namely, the pre-pro­
fessional curriculum and the professional curriculum.
Students who have finished their Junior College work and plan to study law may
enter the Law School and begin the preparation for their professional careers under the
supervision and control of the Law School by entering upon the work of the pre-pro­
fessional year. I
This year of work is planned with the thought of giving the student a background of
information and intellectual discipline which is both cultural and of particular value to
the future law student. Part of the work is prescribed. In order, however, to give free­
dom of choice to the individual student and permit the student to pursue definite in­
tellectual interests which he may have, a considerable part of the year's work lies in the
choice of the student.
Students who are the holders of an A.B., or similar, degree, or who have completed
three years of adequate college training, may enter directly upon their professional stud­
its.1
The professional work of the Law School is designed to give a thorough legal training
to students whose education and maturity have fitted them to pursue professional study
either for the purpose of becoming practicing attorneys or for the purpose of engaging
in the teaching profession or for the purpose of obtaining a broad and comprehensive
legal training as a preparation for a business career. With this end in view, the first year
of professional work is devoted to giving a careful training in methods of legal analysis
and a thorough working knowledge of fundamental legal subjects. In the second and
third years of professional training the student proceeds to a mastery of the more ad­
"anced branches of law in the various fields of business and corporation law, trusts,
property, procedure, practice, public law, and jurisprudence.
The method of study employed in the majority of professional courses is the analysis,
c omparison, and discussion of decided cases in the differen t fields of law. This case method
')f instruction is liberally supplemented by study of statutory materials and, during the
!.tUer part of the period of study, by supervised research in various problems of law
both in seminar courses and individual studies. The purpose of the case method is to
rive an effective knowledge of legal principles and processes and to train the student in
In�ependent and critical legal reasoning: The purpose of the seminar and individual
1rOrk is to develop in the student the ability to deal constructively with a specific prob­
'f:"1D. An effort is also made to create a consciousness of the relations between law and
·;ther fields of knowledge, particularly the social sciences, and to instil an appreciation
.';f the proper functions of the law in modern society.
The course of professional study offered, requiring three academic years for com-

pletion, constitutes a preparation for the practice of law in any English-speaking ju,.. ..
diction. Wherever necessary, emphasis is also laid upon legal, doctrines peculiar t.!
Illinois or to other neighboring states. By taking advantage of the quarter system (�"t
below) students may complete this course in two and one-fourth calendar years.
In both the pre-professional and the professional curriculum all facilities are Jm'
vided for individual development. Students are encouraged to proceed along lines oi
individual effort and study to the full extent of their capacities.
Students may enter the Law School (1) at the beginning of their pre-professional In
school work, (2) at the beginning of their professional work, or (3) with advanced SUb�
ing in professional work.
THE QUARTER SYSTEM
The system prevailing in the University of dividing the work' into quarters U
adopted in the Law School. This plan gives the student a greater flexibility in arran�"t
his work. The quarters are designated as the Summer, Autumn, Winter,and Sprl�r
quarters, beginning respectively in 1933-34 on June 20, October 3, January 2, :atl�
April 2. Each quarter is from eleven to twelve weeks long, and the Summer Qua�r�
is divided into two terms. A recess occurs between successive quarters, except bet�
the Spring and Summer quarters. Any three quarters count as an academic year, and I!
is thus possible to complete the three-year law course in two and one-fourth calerx*..l�
years.
Pre-professional students should advise with the Dean of Pre-professional Studtt!t
as to their courses and the co-ordination with the professional work.
The professional work of the Law School can most advantageously be begun at Ihf
beginning of the Summer or Autumn quarters and students are urged to plan thd:j';�'
professional work with this end in view. Part-time professional work may be begun 1\
the beginning of the Spring Quarter. After beginning the professional work the cou�!
are so arranged that a student by continuing his work through the Summer QU1Ml�
may complete his professional work in two and one-fourth "calendar years. Studee.u
entering with advanced professional standing may do so at the beginning of any q�
ter, or at the Second Term of the Summer Quarter.

t

THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
The degree of Doctor of Law (J.D.) is conferred upon candidates therefor who have
satisfactorily completed the professional courses and who are college graduates.! No
law credits will be counted if they were obtained before the student was qualified to
enter the Law School as a candidate for this degree.
In order to complete the professional course required for the J.D. degree, it is neces­
sary to complete, with a grade of 60 or better, a total of 27 courses of law work distribut­
ed over nine quarters of law school residence. These 27 courses- of work must average 70,
but in figuring this graduation average, a student having credit in excess of the required
27 courses may drop the lowest ones to the extent of this excess. At least 12 courses of
this law work and four quarters of this residence (including the last quarter for which
credit is given) must ordinarily have been at this School and not counted toward a law
degree elsewhere. At least two courses of work must be taken and passed in the last
. required quarter of residence.s
Graduates of approved law schools may obtain a degree in three quarters by satis­
factorily completing 9 courses.
Candidates who complete the work with a graduating average of 80 will receive the
degree cum laude.
CANDIDACY FOR THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF LAWS (LL.B.)
In occasional. instances applicants who cannot satisfy the collegiate requirement!
necessary for a candidacy for the J.D. degree but who have had between two and three
years of collegiate work, and who are of mature years, may be admitted as candidates
for the degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) by special vote of the Faculty. Such ad­
mission will be granted only in unusual circumstances. Applicants desiring to enter I«
the degree should assure themselves well in advance that they will be accepted.
The degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon candidates therefor who
have satisfactorily completed the professional course. Law work done elsewhere by a
student, while inadmissible here for this degree, will be credited toward it only upon
examinations taken after he becomes admissible.
The requirements as to quality of work, grades attained, and honor degrees are the
same as with regard to candidates for the J.D. degree (see above).
Applicants for admission to candidacy for the J.D. or LL.B. degrees will be required
to take an intelligence test and a legal aptitude test at the beginning of the Quarter io
which they enter the Law School.
CANDIDACY FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF
JURISPRUDENCE (J.S.D.)
Candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence a.S.D.) is open to students who
are the holders of a Bachelor's degree and of a degree from some law school of high stand­
ing, and who show a marked ability for legal scholarship. All admissions to candidacy
for this degree are by special vote of the Faculty. Applications should be made not mtd
than April 1.
The J.S.D. degree will be conferred upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:
I Those who have not received the college degree before entering the Law School may qualify for it •
the manner explained above under "Candidacy for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts."
'See section on "Advanced Standing in Professional Work" for application of this rule to those .br-
enter with credit from another law school.· ....
1 When a student registers for fewer than 3 courses in his last calendar quarter, because of needinc ic9
than one quarter of residence to complete the required 9 quarters, this requirement is reduced pro fala.

1. At least three quarters of residence at this School.
2. The satisfactory completion at this Law School of such studies as the Faculty may
prescribe.
3. The submission of a printed dissertation upon invitation by vote of the Faculty
and the acceptance of such dissertation as a creditable contribution to legal science.
ADVANCED STANDING IN PROFESSIONAL WORK
Non-graduates from other law schools of high grade, who are otherwise qualified to
enter the School, may receive credit, not ordinarily exceeding 5 quarters of residence
and 15 courses in amount, for the satisfactory completion of work done there similar in
character to that required here. Graduates of approved law schools may be given a
maximum credit of six quarters and 18 courses (two years). Such credit may not exceed
three courses for each quarter of la w school residence elsewhere, and, in whole or in part,
may be given conditionally or upon examination. Courses for which credit is given are
not assigned grades, whether examinations were required here or not. The number of
courses of credit given for law work taken at other schools is subtracted from the re­
quired 27 courses, and the graduating average of 70 must be obtained for the remaining
number of courses taken at this school. Credit given may be withdrawn if the student's
performance in this Law School is unsatisfactory. No credit will be gi'lJen for work not
tlMU in residence at a law school.
A student who desires to enter the Law School with advanced standing must present
a properly filled out application and a copy of his collegiate and law school record. His
admission and the amount of credit given for advanced standing will be conditionally
determined upon these data. After registering in the School he may be required to take
an intelligence test and to have an interview with the Dean. His right to remain in the
School after the first three quarters of residence may depend in part upon these data.

the completion of the course. No special examinations will be given, nor will part credit
be allowed for any uncompleted course, or for one in which the student has not obtained
I grade of 60 in the examination. Conditions may be removed or advanced standing
obtained at the next regular examinations.
A student who has had but one examination in a course in which his grade is below
70 may take a second examina tion therein, and his second grade shall replace the first.

Verne Noyes, provides in the Colleges and in the Divisions and Professional Schools,
tuition scholarships in part or in full for deserving students who: (1) shall themselves
have served in the Army or Navy of the United States in the War for liberty into which
the Republic entered on April 6, 1917, or (2) shall be descendants by blood of anyone in
the service in the Army or Navy of the United States who served in said war; or (3) shall
be descendants by blood of anyone who served in the Army or Navy of the United
States in said war, provided that such service was terminated by an honorable death or
an honorable discharge. The amount of the scholarship depends upon the circumstances
of each case. The scholarships are awarded quarterly and the formal application should
be filed at least five weeks before the beginning of the quarter for which the scholarship
is desired. Application should be made to the office of the Committee on Fellowships
and Scholarships. .
University Fellowships.-Several fellowships are available to candidates for the de­
gree of J.S.D. and may be awarded to suitable applicants in the discretion of the Law
Faculty. Applications therefore should be made not later than April 15. Directions for
making such applications will be sent upon request.
LOAN FUNDS.
There are numerous loan funds established through the generosity of various friends
of the Law School. Loans may be obtained from these funds by Law School students'
upon a proper showing of the need of financial assistance. Such loans are available only
to students who have had at least three quarters of residence in the School.
The Ernst Freund Loan Fund, established in 1922 by the late Professor Ernst Freund
and since his death augmented by other contributions.

which loans may be made to students in need of financial assistance. The amount of the
loan is limited to one-half of the student's tuition charge. The loans bear interest at 5
per cent, are for not over one year, but mayan proper showing be extended. Loans may
be made from this fund to students entering the Law School, either for pre-professional

SELF HELP
A large number of students in various ways earn a portion of their expenses while
in the University. There are opportunities for part-time work in restaurants, stores,
hotels, etc. There is also a limited number of opportunities for remunerated work with
the University. The latter resource is opened to those who have spent at least one quar-

ter in residence at the University. While, of course, the University can make no guaran­
tee as to employment, it makes all possible efforts to find opportunities for work for the
student. All inquiries regarding self-help for students should be addressed to the Board
of Vocational Guidance and Placement, University of Chicago ..
Members of the Faculty have occasion from time to time to employ students of out­
standing ability to assist them in doing research work.
EMPLOYMENT AFTER GRADUATION
While of course the Law School cannot pledge itself in any way to provide positions
for graduating students, no man of good character who graduates from this school with a
high record need have any doubt about securing a position. The Dean's Office, the Bu­
reau of Vocational Guidance and Placement, and a very active committee of the Law
School Alumni Association co-operate in placing graduates of the School.

CARE OF STUDENTS' HEALTH
The University offers health service for students registered on the Quadrangles.

wives or to full-time employees even though they may be enrolled for part-time instruc­
tion. Students are urged to make use of the service to the fullest extent. Persons paying
more than one-half of the full tuition will not be charged for ordinary care at the Health

pay.
MEDICAL EXAMINATION
A medical examination, appointment for which should be made at the time of
registration, is required of every student in residence for the first time with the excep­
tion that, in the Summer Quarter only, medical examination is optional for graduate
students. The examination is designed to protect the individual against work for which
he is physically unqualified, to discover defects and tendencies which may be corrected,
and to guard the University community against communicable disease. Vaccination
against smallpox is obligatory for all students.
Failure to report for a medical examination within the first two weeks of the Quarter
or to keep an appointment already made necessitates the payment of a late fee of $2.00.
This fee should be paid at the Bursar's Office and the receipt brought to the Health
Service.

The standards of the American Bar Association were adopted in 1921. They provide
that all persons admitted to the Bar should have graduated from a Law School that
requires of its students (1) at least two years of college preparation as a prerequisite
for admission to the School, (2) at least three academic years of study before obtaining
its degree. Such a Law School must also have an adequate library and a. sufficient
number of full-time teachers to give adequate personal contact with the student body,
and it shall not be operated as a commercial enterprise.
These standards have, in whole or in part, been adopted by statute in many states.
