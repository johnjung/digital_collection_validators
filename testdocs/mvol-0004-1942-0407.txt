dean of the Division of the Physical
Sciences, announced yesterday. The
Civilian Aeronautics .Administration
has requested the University to re¬
sume the pilot training which was
dropped last year when CAA budget
was cut.
In the previous training, 125 stu¬
dent pilots, many of them now in
military aviation, were given instruc¬
tion. Because the request was received
after the spring quarter opened, the
quota for the quarter is much
smaller than the summer quota will
be if the training is reinstated-here.
A reorganization of the program
has resulted in Cyril O. Houle, in¬
structor in education and research
associate in political science, replac¬
ing Bartky as co-ordinator of the pro¬
gram. Information about the course
can be obtained from him. The fee
for the medical examination is being
paid by the government now.
Ground instruction will be given at
the University and flight training at
the Ford-Lansing Airport by Robert
J, Slump.
Eligible students must be between
19 and 26 years of age and have
satisfactorily completed 45 quarter
hours of study. Those who have a
pilot certificate of private grade or
higher are ineligible. Applications
may be obtained in Cobb 108, and
registration closes this week.

Elections in
Mandel Thurs.
Dorothy Teberg, president of the
Mirror Board, announced yesterday
that elections for next year’s board
will be held in Mandel Clorridor this
Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 5.
Any girl who worked on a committee
and had her name in the program
will be eligible to vote.
Candidates for president of the
board are Jane Moran and Janet Wag¬
ner who were publicity and stage
manager respectively this year.
In addition to the president, five
other members are to be chosen for
the board. The board candidate re¬
ceiving the highest number of votes
will automatically assume the office
of vice-president.

these classes see Page 4.)
The meeting has two purposes ac¬
cording to Smith. One is to obtain a
list of all men interested in any of the
three classes, and the second is to an¬
swer any questions about the various
programs or, if they can’t answer the
question, to get the answer.
Plans originally called for a repi*e-
sentative of the V-1 class to be present
w’ith Berwanger, but he was unable to
come. There will probably be another
meeting for this class later.
The same movie was shown on cam¬
pus recently by Lieutenant Gillerlain,
but he met little response. It is be¬
lieved that this meeting will be well
attended, how'ever.
Berwanger was recently commis¬
sioned lieutenant, junior grade, and
has been assigned to procurement dut¬
ies on the Naval Aviation Cadet Selec¬
tion Board. An interesting sidelight
of his induction was that the oath was
administered by Lieut. Gillerlain, who
played football here when Berwanger
captained the team in 1936.
Three other graduates of the Uni¬
versity are now serving in various
ranks in the Naval Air Corps. John
Leeper, ’24, and James Loeb, ’36, have
finished their elimination training and
are now cadets, while Daniel Barnes is
beginning his elimination training at
Glenview.
Leeper, Loeb, and Barnes, upon
completion of their months of inten¬
sive flight and ground school training
will be commissioned Naval flying
officers with the rank of ensign in the
Naval Reserve,
Lieut. Berwanger was an All-Amer¬
ican in football while attending the

Milton Mayer Answers Queries on
‘Case Against The Jew’ Article
By PHILIP RIEFF
In six thundering words, which were
culled from the writings of an old
reformer named Lsaiah, Milton Mayer
has posed an essential problem of con¬
temporary society and has split about
5,000,000 people into argumentative
little factions. “In righteousness shalt
thou be established” say Isaiah and
Mayer.
But Mayer said it in the Saturday
Evening Post. Essentially, he asked
humanity to turn from crass material¬
ism to “radical righteousness.” But
he asked it of the Jews, who he said
are materialistic, as are the Chris¬
tians in an article called “The Case
Against The Jews,” in the March 28
issue of the Post.
To those who say that it was “all
right to be realistic about the Jews,
but not in the Saturday Evening
Post,” Mayer answers:
“Some people have written me that
it would be all right to say it in a
Jewish magazine, or even in a maga¬
zine like the Nation, and my only an¬
swer is that this article is addressed
to the Jews only secondarily. Prima¬
rily, it is addressed to the typical Sat¬
urday Evening Post readers; that is,
the middle-class Gentile who does not
know many Jews—if any—but has
heard a lot about the Jews, from not
always reliable sources.
“My article was addressed to these
Gentiles.
“I have seen every other conceiv¬
able kind of defense of the Jews ad¬
dressed to the Gentiles. I have seen

Dine and Vote
Keystone, the all-campus women’s
organization, is having a dinner meet¬
ing Thursday at 6 on the second floor
of Ida Noyes. After supper, officers
for next year will be elected.
Reservations for this affair, open to
:dl women, may be made either by
every other conceivable kind of at¬
tack against Anti-Semiticism ad¬
dressed to the Gentile. It becomes clear
to me over the years, as I suppose it
has to all of us, that these standard
defenses and standard attacks simply
haven’t worked.
“I’ve seen Gentiles who believe that
the Jews controlled the American
banking system. I’ve seen these Gen¬
tiles shdwn that Jews control only 2
per cent of the American banking
system. And I have seen these same
Gentiles go on believing that the Jews
controlled the American banking sys¬
tem.
“The Gentiles I’m talking about are,
by and large, well-meaning, decent
people who, because they do not know
Jews and who do not know much
about Jews except what they hear in
the streets, are likely to be Anti-
Semitic in time of trouble.
“In my article I tried to talk to
these people in a way no defense of
the Jews or any attack on Anti-Semi-
contacting Pat Peterson, Gates Hall,
or by signing in the places provided j tism has ever talked to them. I tried,
on the bulletin boards. A small fee first, to make them see that this was

The Student Social Committee will
present the second annual Viennese
Ball on the evening of May 1. As last
year, the dance will be held in the
Ida Noyes Gymnasium.
Under the leadership of Kenneth
MacLellan, chairman of the commit¬
tee, an unusual band has been signed
for the evening. Consisting of eight
pieces, the oichestra, which replaces
the University Symphony, at present
practicing for a concert under Fred¬
erick Stock, will alternate at Strauss
waltzes and swing styled after Artie
Shaw.
When playing waltzes, the orches¬
tra will consist of four violins, a cello,
a harp, a viola, and a piano. At other
times, to provide variety, the versatile
musicians will switch to brasses and
drums to give out in a modern style.
The orchestra is scheduled to open
at the Old Heidelberg shortly after
the Viennese Ball.
As originated last year, women are
expected to wear formal attire while
the men may wear either tuxedoes or
dark suits.
The admission charge will be one
dollar per couple, tax included.

a Jew who was willing to face the
facts about the Jewish elite. The facts
being that the Jewish elite was trying
to be just like the Gentile elite. In
the third place, having, I hoped, won
the confidence of the typical Gentile
reader, I tried to show him that only
the Jewish-Christian tradition could
save the world, that he had abandoned

THE DAILY MAROON. TUESDAY. APRIL 7. 1942
The New Reasoning Bill
Versus The People
Smoldering under an amazing
lack of publicity, a bill to re-zone
the city is pending before the
city council.
The bill would divide the city
into use districts, including
districts reserved for family res¬
idences, apartment houses, and
business establishments. It
would zone 40 percent instead of
5 percent of Chicago for “family
residences”. The areas in which
small businesses can operate will
be drastically restricted.
Under this law it would be im¬
possible to open a shop, restau¬
rant, retail store, or even an of¬
fice anywhere in an apartment
building or “family residence.”
The bill also provides that:
“All non-conforming specialty
shop, business, commercial,
manufacturing uses in Family
Residence, Duplex Residence,
Apartment House, and Group
House districts shall be discon¬
tinued within two years after
the effective date of this ordi¬
nance unless then maintained in a
building designed for such non-
conforming use which is not old¬
er than 50 years, in which event
such non-conforming use of the
building shall be discontinued
when 50 years have elapsed from
the time it was erected, recon¬
structed in part or enlarged.”

Which means that anyone who
w’as unlucky enough to be run¬
ning a business in the wrong
zone with the wrong kind of
building design would have to
move out within two years.
But there is an outfit which
calls itself the Hyde Park Prop¬
erty Owner’s Association. This
organization didn’t think the bill
was strict enough. Their repre¬
sentative testified before the
City Council Committee on Zon¬
ing that two small establish¬
ments on 51st and Cornell
wouldn’t be run out of business
by the new law.
While the zoning laws of Chi¬
cago certainly need to be clari¬
fied, these laws should be made
less, not more, restrictive. Too
many people in the real estate
business, too many property
owners, and too many big busi¬
ness men are out to get the
small business men. They can’t
tolerate competition from little
hemstitchers, boarding house
managers, gasoline salesmen,
photographers, shoemakers, res¬
taurants, gift shops, and crafts¬
men w’ho even at the top of pros¬
perity have a difficult time earn¬
ing a living.
The organized minorities who
are practicing such economic
cannibalism would call them¬
selves the best of rugged indi¬
vidualists. Yet they are advocat¬
ing restrictions on business that
should be the envy of the most
extreme Bolshevik. They believe
in all the song and story of free
enterprize. Yet in a concrete
practical situation, they are the
first ones to go out and get the
little business man who is the
only real source of competition.
The pallbearers of a dead era
do not see any connection be¬
tween free enterprize and a com¬
petitive system. They identify
the “American Way” with their
own monopoly power.
In wartime we ought to use
all resources. The war will create
a tremendous housing shortage
in Chicago. Priorities prevent
building new houses or apart¬
ments. Yet buildings in residence
areas can’t be converted into
boarding houses. These buildings
must stand idle or be used at
much less than capacity as a
tribute to the power of organized
minorities of property owners.
In some restricted zones people
who are not blood relatives will
be practically prohibited from
eating in the same building. We
refer anyone who is skeptical to
what happened under the old
more liberal zoning bill. At 5001
Woodlawn a group of young peo¬
ple, some of them students, rent¬
ed a building. They paid their
rent. They took good care of the
building. Yet before their lease
had expired they were de-zoned
out. Under the zoning law, that
a 16 room old mansion can only
be rented to a family. Unless
there is a sudden, drastic in¬
crease in the size of American
families such a zoning law is a
new low in inane wastefullness.
The organized property own¬
ers do not seem to be concerned
about people who cannot find
adequate housing or people who
are forced out of business. They
are concerned about the value of
their property. They are afraid
that a small business or someone
from one of the lower income
brackets might move into an ex¬
clusive neighborhood. They fear
“deterioration” of property more
than the deterioration of people
from inadequate housing.
Incidentally students ought to
be interested in this bill. Hous¬
ing facilities around the Univer¬
sity are becoming increasingly
scarce. Students may have to
rent more and more attics and
basements unless more family
residences are converted into
boarding houses. Under the pro¬
posed zoning bill the area be-
j tween 56th and 58th from Uni¬
versity to Kenwood will be zoned
for “family residences” thereby
making it impossible to start
any student housing or eating
establishments in this area.
The hearings on this bill are
finished. But it still must be ap¬
proved by the City Council. The
property owners will probably
run the show at the city council
unless the thousands of people
who are threatened by the law
become organized and articulate
enough to have a share in law¬
making. If we must have zon¬
ing in Chicago, let’s have zon¬
ing for all interest groups, not
merely for those with the most
money and influence and the
strongest “organizations.” The
present zoning bill ought to be
defeated and replaced by anoth¬
er more liberal zoning law drawn
up with the advice of property
owners, property renters, large
business men, and small business
men.

Easter has went,. . .
...but its mepjory lingers on, em¬
bodied in the bizarre and exotic hats
it brought out. Even collitch girls
were walking about adorned with
birds and feathers. It was also a rare
sight to see some of the University
women wearing dresses instead of
skirts and sweaters. They were al¬
most unrecognizable as they stopped
for a day futilely trying to look like
Lana Turner when the closest they
come to her is having the same num¬
ber of arms and legfs.
The T. Wally Johnsons (he’s an in¬
structor in history) threw a party for
the Hart Perrys Friday night. Among
those present were Bob Reynolds, who
late in the evening came to the con¬
clusion that Mary Lu Price really did

have a spare torso they can give to
him? Or would anyone like a couple
of extra legs! The tibia might make
a very fine soup.
And then there is Brad Patterson.
Some of us who knew him when he
was a freshman are still disconcerted
by hi.s metamorphosis, but metamor¬
phosed he has. For example, in the
room of his lady friend, Shirley Du-
Bos. is a minute-by-minute .schedule
of his whereabouts which he made out
for her. Friday, Saturday, and Sun¬
day nights are left blank save for an
asterisk. The explanatory note at the

Chicago’s baseball team makes a
unique trip today. The Maroons travel
to Joliet to play the Stateville Peni¬
tentiary team.
Every prison has its share of con¬
victs who love athletics more than
anything else in their drab world.
Often, they are men who might have
been semi-pro performers if their fu¬
tures had not been decided otherwise.
Prison teams are often of good semi-
pro caliber, capable of giving college
teams a lacing. Alabama Pitts, famed
athlete from Sing Sing, a decade ago,
was famous throughout the country.
The Saga of Pitts
When the colorful Alabama left the
Rig House after completing his term,
a nation-wide controversy arose as to
whether he could continue to capital¬
ize his ability in professional sports.
However the big athlete never did
break into major league ball, as scouts
predicted while he was cleaning the
bases for the Sing Sing nine.
Feeling against prison teams, wide¬
spread and deeply rooted not long ago,
has decreased amazingly in the past
ten years. Chicago's baseballers look
forward tc this trip just as they would
for any other. A lively contest is in
prospect before an audience probably
more appreciative than any other the
Maroons will perform for this season.
Prison vs. College
In a way the Midway team is
performing a valuable mission, for
Joliet inmates have probably always
wondered how their nine would fare
against a team of college boys. But
since prison teams find it difficult to
persuade hesitant authorities to let
them travel for outside games, we
may never be able to repay their hos¬
pitality.

As bursting buds and prone bodies
make a heaven of our hell, the most
ancient and respected of athletic pur¬
suits takes on new life as Coach Ned
Merriam’s track team forsakes the
now comandeered Fieldhouse for the
great outdoors. This, of course, is
dependent upon whether the athletic
fields are firm or whether they return
to their nineteenth century marshy
condition.
Sad Plight
Impossible to forget is the sad
plight of the Moroons in the recent
conference indoor meet in which,
plagued by injuries, they scored a big
zero in the point column.
The potency of this year’s aggrega¬
tion is closely packed in several per¬
formers, of whom Bob Kincheloe and
Ray Randell appear to possess real
quality. Kincheloe is one of the spark¬
ling vaulters of this neck of the
woods, while Randall is a consistently
good performer over the middle dis¬
tances.
Hopefuls
Gordon Rapier tried and proven this
winter over sixty yards should man¬
age well enough in the dashes, with
Don Boyes stepping in to fill up a
rather vacant hurdle position, aided
by the aformentioned Kincheloe. Two
W’s, Wmkleman and Wilner will
handle the 880 and 440 respectively.
From here it appears that the biggest
gaps are the field events, with many

Qaims India Better Governed
Today—Other Asiatic Neighbors
By DOROTHY SPERBER
India is in a better condition today
than any other of her Asiatic neigh¬
bors mainly because of the excellent
administration of the British Civil
Service. This according to Professor
George Bobrinskoy, is the main rea¬
son why India may be justified in her
desire for self-government at the pres¬
ent time. Mr. Bobrinskoy, who was
heard last Sunday on the Chicago
Roundtable broadcast on India, is also
encouraged by the excellent show of
iuternal self-government that the In¬
dians have given since the Act of
1035, which removed the direct rule
of the British over their local affairs.
“It is admitted by everyone,” he
said, “that the resulting governing
experience from 1937 to 1939 showed
the administrative record surprising¬
ly good. The local governments in the
11 main states showed no serious
break-down, and profited tremendous¬
ly by the examples of the famed Brit-
ish-Indian Civil Service that governed
before them.”
Civil Service
The Moslem League still complains
of discrimination from the Congress
Nationalist Party, and there are a
myriad of lesser internal squabbles,
but Mr. Bobrinskoy sees signs that
the Indian Civil Service will continue
in the footsteps of its senior member,
the B.C.S. that ought to forestall any
serious conflicts. He considers it a
not too remote point that India may
someday become embroiled in an ex¬
hausting civil war, but hopes that
the administration will be sufficiently
powerful to prevent it.
“British military control will have
to remain for the duration of the war,
no matter >^'hat is the outcome of the
present bid for independence, because
the Indians have had no time to de¬
velop skilled commanders,” Mr. Bob¬
rinskoy explained.
No Menace
If India gets the defense minister
she is oggling for, the best qualified
man for the job is probably Sikander
Hyat Khan, who has a particularly
brilliant record in the administration
of Punjab. In case of a compromise
with the British, he is apt to be more
liberal than any of the other leaders.
His views are more moderate, and he
particularly sympathizes with the
British position.
Whatever the final decision on the
present Indian crisis, Mr. Bobrinskoy
does not feel that India will ever be¬
come an aggressive menace to the
British Empire. “They never have
been, and their psychology of leader¬
ship doesn’t consider such a course.
Nor has Axis propaganda undermined
the bulk of India. The only man re¬
motely affected by the all-out Japa¬
nese cajoling is Buse, a leader who
hasn’t been of much importance since
he was second-in-command to Gandhi
and Nehru of the Congress Party.
And I see it reported in the papers
that Mr. Buse died recently in a
‘mysterious airplane crash’.”

“The April 14 primary election will
put the skids under one of the last
remaining political cancers in this
country—the Kelly-Nash machine,” it
was predicted Saturday by Paul H.
Douglas, University economics Pro¬
fessor and independent candidate for
Democratic nomination for United
States senator, in the opening address
of h’s Chicago-area campaign before
the “Franklin D. Roosevelt Club” at
the Hotel Sherman.
Good Reception
Douglas, who has just returned
from a sensationally successful tour
of more than 60 Illinois counties,
spoke together with Frank J. Mc¬
Adams, candidate for congressman-
at-large. Presiding at the meeting
was Robert W. McKinlay, president
of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club.
Reporting on the reception given
the independent candidates to Illinois,
Douglas said:
“Frank McAdams and I have re¬
ceived the most heartening reassur¬
ance from every section of Illinois
that the great majority of our citizens
are determined to put national unity
above partisanship to insure American
victory. Downstate Illinois will go to
the polls on April 14 with two ob¬
jectives—support of President Roose¬
velt’s war policy and rebuke of the
Kelly-Nash machine. As we went
through the downstate counties, we
found that Kelly-Nash sentiment had
completely evaporated. Only the most
half-hearted campaign was being
made for the machine ticket.
“The trend we found throughout Il¬
linois substantiates the straw poll be¬
ing taken by a Chicago newspaper
which shows that we are leading the
machine downstate by a majority of
two-to-one. This overwhelming Illinois
support combines with the lead in Chi¬
cago to give us a pre-election ma¬
jority of 15 per cent.
Optimism
“We know from their behavior in
past elections, that the last trick of
the Kelly-Nash machine will be to
concede defeat on the issues involved
and attempt to win by a last minute
campaign of personal villification and,
if this is not enough, to steal the elec¬
tion outright. We will be prepared for
both desperate last-minute maneuvers.
“Kansas City has just delivered the
second knock-down to the Prendergast
machine in Kansas City in its recent
election; Tammany is through in New
York; the Long machine is just a
memory in Louisiana; and we are
now in a position to put the skids un¬
der one of the last remaining political
cancers in this country—the Kelly-
Nash machine.”
When President Hutchins said that
the University would do all it could
for defense, the Oriental Institute be¬
gan taking stock of its facilities to
see what it could do.
Peeling that the war would event¬
ually go into the Near East, and that
therefore trained people would be
needed not only during the war, but
also for the post war work of rehabili¬
tation, the Institute decided on two
types of courses, linguistics and a
general course on the Near East. But
since Phillip Ireland of the Political
Science department is already giving
a course on Diplomacy in the Near
East, they decided this course would
be sufficient in that field.
The spoken language courses, how¬
ever, were attempted, for the first
time in the history of the Institute.
All these courses, with the exception
of Iraqi, had to be discontinued due
to lack of student demand.
Any students or non-students who
are interested in taking any courses
on spoken language of the Near East
should contact the Oriental Institute.

gerous person to know. Ever since
rehearsals began for “Ladies in
Retirement,” the play which the
University Players are giving in
the Reynolds Club theater tomor¬

Apprich has shown a skill at
strangling in cold blood that makes
even strong men shrink at the sight
of her,
W’ith the aid of a sturdy cord
Miss Apprich as Ellen Crt‘ed makes
short work of Mrs. Bourie Davis,
who plays Miss Fiske. This blowly
bu.siness takes place at the end of
the first act. From there on, Miss
Apprich is a respectable, law-abid¬
ing citizen but anyone who has wit¬
nessed her committing the crime
is inclined to avoid her in dark
alleys.
Less violent members of the cast
are besides Mrs. Davis: Lt)is Sam-

Gowan, Marilyn Lingott and Bob

recting the play.
T.V. Smith
Speaks on
Democracy
“Democracy is a doctrine of revolu-
tion. But once the revolution has sue-
ceeded, if democracy is to be pre-
served it passes into a doctrine of
evolution.”
This statement was made yester
day by Dr. T. V. Smith, professor of
philosophy at the University, in u
lecture here on “Tom Paine: Voice of
Democractic Revolution.” The address
was the first in a series sponsored
during the spring quarter by the
Charles R. Walgreen Foundation for
the Study of American Institutions.
No Violence
"Tom Paine, founding father of
American citizenship, belonged to the
first, or revolutionary stage of denioc.
racy,” Dr. Smith said, “As pam¬
phleteer of the American Revolution,
hi.s thunderbolts reverberate in Ameri-
can ears even to this day.”
Paine’s assertion that “The summer
soldier and the sunshine patriot will
in this crisis, shrink from service to
their country,” might have been writ-
ten for the present emergency. Dr.
Smith observed.
Yet Paine was not devoted to vio¬
lence; as a Quaker he tolerated it
only as a last resort. He believed,
however, that citizens in a democracy
should have enough stamina to wage
a necessary war, and tolerance enough
to endure the best peace that could
be made at its conclusion. This is in
strange contrast to his own intoler¬
ance of the outcome of an action that
did not meet his ideals. He servini
the ideal of liberty, with, as Dr, Smith
pointed out, “no continuing obei.saiicc
to the reality.”
Campaigner
His roots were never deep in any
national soil. He himself said, “When-
liberty is not, there is my home.” He
campaigned for liberty, but never
stayed to .see the result of a revolu¬
tion betray his ideals. He was a true
and honest revolutionist, “one who
could never bwome an evolutionist or
a gradualist. However,” added Dr.
Smith, "They also serve democracy,
who only poke and prml,”
Maroon Presents ABC’s’ of Naval
Training Program for Students
Many people are not aware that it
takes almost as long to make a sailor
as it takes to build a warship—and
that the Navy’s greatest need, at the
moment, is skilled man power. Be¬
sides teaching more than 50 trade
skills to the recruits who are stream¬
ing through its training stations, the
Navy must select and train thousands
of college men who by their education¬
al backgrounds are already qualified
for ratings and commissions. To this
end, it has instituted a “V” program
with which every undergraduate
should be familiar.
To aid both the Navy and the under¬
graduate interested in volunteer naval
service, the Maroon today presents
ti’e "A, B, C’s” of the Naval Reserve’s
“V” program:
V-1
- Pre-Indoctrination Training
This is the latest procurement plan
—a plan whereby the Navy hopes to
obtain 80,000 preindoctrinated train¬
ees per year. College freshmen and
sophomores between the ages of 17
and 19 inclusive who are of good
moral character and in good physical
condition may enlist in Class V-1 as
apprentice seamen. After approxi¬
mately three semesters, during which
they will study related Navy subjects,
taught by the regular college faculty,
V-1 men will be given a general ex¬
amination. Those ranking sufficiently
high in the examination may transfer
to Class V-5 or V-7 (see below) and
continue their inactive status until
completion of the academic require¬
ments for those classes. Those whose
scores on the examination are too low
to warrant V-5 or V-7 training will
be allowed to complete the 4-semester
indoctrination course and then be call¬
ed to active duty as apprentice sea¬
men. For further information or en¬
listment consult the University regis¬
trar or the nearest Navy recruiting
office.
V.2
Naval Aviation Mechanics
This is an opportunity for men be¬
tween the ages of 17 and 28 inclusive
with limited experience or demon¬
strable interest in internal combustion
engines or metal work. They will re¬
ceive 26 weeks intensive training
which will qualify them for petty of¬
ficers’ ratings as aviation machinists
and aviation metalsmiths,
V-3
Naval Communications
Here is an opening for men inter¬
ested in wireless and visual signals.
They must enlist as apprentice sea¬
men, but will be sent to a communica¬
tions service school if, at the conclu¬
sion of their recruit training, they
show a preference and aptitude for
this classification. The training they
receive during their first year of serv¬
ice is worth $1,500, according to the
Navy.
V-4
Naval Intelligence
College men of “outstanding charac¬
ter and unquestioned reliability” with
legal training or stenographic ability
were formerly enlisted as yeomen
(“seagoing secretaries”) in this clas¬
sification. Quotas were filled shortly
after Pearl Harbor, but may be re¬
opened.
V-5
Most Navy men regard this classi¬
fication as the best opportunity in
the Naval Reseiwe. To be admitted
you must be between the ages of 19
and 26 inclusive, unmarried, and in
good shape physically. Those who
have not yet finished the i*equired two
years of college may enlist and con¬
tinue school until they have completed
these requirements. Enlisters will re¬
ceive 90 days training at one of the
18 reserve aviation bases, then be
shipped to the “Annapolis of the Air”
(at Pensacola, Fla.) or to Jackson-

V-6
Volunteer Specialists
This classification covers nearly all
of the Navy’s 55 petty officer special¬
ist ratings. A petty officer’s rating in
the Navy is equivalent in pay and
rank to that of a sergeant in the
Army. ^
V-7
Midshipman Training
In earning the required college de¬
gree, you must complete two semes¬
ters of math, including one cour.se in
plane trigonometry. You will then be
given 30 days’ indoctrination at Notre
Dame University and sent to one of
the midshipman schools—at North¬
western or Columbia or aboard the
USS Prairie State in New York City.
Upon completion of this 90-day course
in seamanship, navigation, ordnance
and gunnery, you will be commission¬
ed an ensign in the Naval Reserve,
with salary and allowances totaling
$183 per month.
